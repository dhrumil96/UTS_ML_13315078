One of the conceptual issue was calculated that was the means by which to seperate the hyperplane that can sum up better in high dimensionality in feature space. Arrangement of this issue was settled in 1965 which is spot result of the vector with its relating weight will frame the linear combination of the suppport vector. Another issue was technical that was how to handle high polynomial degree in feature space. And solution for the technical issue was given by the (Boser et al, 1992) that instead of doing dot-product of support vectors to generate non-linear transformation one can compare two vectors such as measuring some distance this helps to build better classes of decision surfaces.\n",

Utilizing chosen non-linear mapping of input vectors into high dimensional feature space Z group on the training dataset this machine learning known as support vector network. In this space a linear surface is built with extraordinary properties that guarantee high speculation capacity of the system. In the paper it has shown optimal hyperplane algorithm for separation of the training data without error. Even before this paper writtern support vector was only able to classify in two groups without erros but in this paper suggested method of Soft Margin Hyperplane allows to training data can not be seperated without error. Method of Convolution of the dot product in feature space suggests a vector function which can transform the n-dimensional input vector x into an N-dimensional feature vector. In this convolution of dot product, according to the Hilbert-Schmidt theory every symmetric function can be transformed to the integral operator defined by kernal k(u,v). To provide co-efficient are positive it is necessary to satisfy  Mercer's theorem. Using various dot product function anyone can create machine learning with arbitary types of decision surface.\n"
